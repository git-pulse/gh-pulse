#### How to install

```
gh extension install git-pulse/gh-pulse
```

**How to:** Use the `gh-pulse` extension to show a [pulse snapshot](#pulse-snapshots) of the past 6 months of committer activity and issue/PR activity for any git/GitHub repo by doing this: `cd` into your local clone of any repo, and run the following:

```bash
gh pulse -i 6
```

Example output:

## Pulse snapshots

A **pulse snapshot** is a report that answers questions about a project — questions such as the following:

- **How many contributors are actually active each month?**
- **How many new contributors is the project gaining each month?**
- **How many commits are getting merged each month?**
- **How well is the project managing issues and PRs?**
  - **How long does an issue or PR typically stay open before it’s resolved?**
  - **How many issues and PRs are there which have stayed open for a long time without being resolved?**
  - **At what rate are the lists of open issues and PRs increasing or decreasing?**

The `gh-pulse` extension generates snapshots with data and graphs that answer those questions.

## Usage notes

- The month ranges shown are for logical months based on the current date (today) rather than calendar months. That is, each “month” range shown ends on the same calendar day as today — rather than being a calendar month starting on the 1st of a given month and ending on the 30th, 31st, 28th, or 29th.

- Unless you have either `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` set in your environment, running this extension will likely cause you to quickly exceed the GitHub API rate limits for requests, and start getting 403 error responses.

- Even with `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` set, the extension takes several minutes to run, due to some throttling (delay between API calls) added to avoid hitting GitHub API rate limits for (authenticated) requests.

  To adjust the throttling between API call), run with the `-s` option set to a number of seconds (default 9):

  ```
  gh pulse -s10
  ```

- To generate a snapshot for a date range going back from an earlier day than today, install `faketime` (e.g., with `apt install faketime` or `brew install faketime`) and run `gh-pulse` like this:

  ```
  faketime -f "@2021-05-01 23:59:59" gh pulse
  ```

  **Note:** `faketime` won’t work on macOS or other systems with the BSD `date` command. On such systems, use the `-d` option to specify the GNU `date` command rather than the default `date` command; for example, on a macOS system, install the [Homebrew `coreutils` package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils), and run with the `-d` option set like this:

  ```
  brew install coreutils
  faketime -f "@2021-05-01 23:59:59" gh pulse -d/usr/local/bin/gdate
  ```

- If a repo/clone has a remote named `upstream` defined, the extension uses that remote; otherwise it uses `origin`.

- The `-i` option tells the `gh-pulse` extension to interactively page though the snapshot in your terminal. To instead non-interactively generate a report, just omit the `-i` option.
